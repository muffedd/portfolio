Overview & objective

    Build an audience by showcasing weekly cover art that encourages social follows, repeat visits, and simple direct contact without friction.

    Mirror the inspiration’s three‑column feel while keeping the left Info card visible at first and collapsing after a short scroll to give the gallery maximum space.

    Keep content updates simple: swap images weekly, allow mixed ratios (1:1 and 16:9), and choose per‑post caption style with minimal effort.

Audience snapshot

    Primary: college students who prefer fast, visual‑first browsing with clear identity and minimal reading to decide if a creator is worth following.

    Secondary: design‑curious peers who appreciate consistent series rhythm and a calm, premium interface with subtle motion.

    Expected behavior: quick scan on mobile, revisit on new drops, bounce to socials from the first screen or contact when something resonates.

Essential sections & content outline

    Info tab: avatar, tagline “Better late than Basic,” short 2–3 line bio, compact social icons, visible on load then collapses after a short scroll threshold.

    Playground tab: oversized “Latest Drop” first tile followed by a mixed‑ratio stream of covers with customizable captions per post (title only by default).

    Contact tab: concise invite to collaborate plus a single primary method to reduce decision fatigue and support direct outreach quickly.

    Right highlights rail: non‑clickable mini previews of recent or favorite covers to add ambient brand texture without distracting from the main feed.

Wireframe‑level layout

    Global frame: three columns with pill‑style tabs at the top (Info, Contact, Playground), rounded cards, and airy spacing that reads iOS‑native.

    Left column (Info): avatar + tagline on top, short bio below, social icons at the bottom, collapsing into a compact chip after the initial scroll threshold.

    Center column (Playground): hero tile for the latest cover at the top followed by a vertically scrolling gallery mixing 1:1 and 16:9 tiles with uniform padding.

    Right column (Highlights): small, tight thumbnails of covers that subtly rotate over time but remain non‑interactive to keep focus on the main stream.

Visual style guidelines

    Palette: light‑first neutrals with graphite‑only accents; emphasis comes from scale, spacing, and imagery rather than color pops.

    Cards: medium corner rounding and flat, hairline shadows for separation that feels calm and premium without heavy depth.

    Motion: subtle iOS micro‑motion—gentle fades, small scale on hover, soft tab transitions, and a smooth collapse for the Info panel that never competes with the art.

Typography guidelines

    Pairing: clean sans for UI labels and headings, paired with a refined serif for select titles or hero lines to add editorial polish without visual noise.

    Tone: crisp, high‑contrast type that stays unobtrusive so the artwork remains the hero across the gallery and highlights rail.

    Rhythm: short, scannable text blocks with consistent line lengths to maintain a quick decision loop for students.

Content creation model

    Weekly drop workflow: export cover images in 1:1 and/or 16:9 as the design dictates, then choose caption variant per post (default title only) for fast publishing.

    Consistency cues: keep the first 2–3 rows especially strong so returning visitors see novelty immediately after the Info panel collapses.

    Social lift: ensure the Info block’s avatar, tagline, and compact icons are visible on first load to convert curiosity into follows before the user scrolls away.

Responsiveness & accessibility basics

    Mobile grid: show two covers per row to balance scan speed and image impact for small screens used by students.

    Mixed ratios: maintain uniform padding and consistent gaps so 1:1 and 16:9 feel orderly and intentional in the same stream.

    Accessibility: always include alt text for covers, maintain readable contrast on light surfaces, and size taps generously for tabs and chips.

Navigation & behavior

    Tabs: Info, Contact, Playground in pill style for immediate clarity and a familiar feel that mirrors the inspiration.

    Info collapse: delay collapse until after a short scroll threshold so the first screen lands credibility before maximizing gallery space.

    No archive, no series tags: keep the stream linear and momentum‑based to emphasize weekly freshness and reduce choice overload.

Image / asset checklist

    Covers: weekly exports in 1:1 and/or 16:9 with clean edges and consistent margins around art to preserve the calm iOS feel.

    Avatar: clear, high‑contrast image that reads well at small sizes beside the tagline.

    Social icons: compact, monochrome glyphs that align with graphite‑only accent rules.

Platform approach (conceptual)

    Prioritize a content model that allows swapping images and editing captions without touching layout, preserving the inspiration’s structure while simplifying weekly updates.

    Keep media handling simple: accept both 1:1 and 16:9, render full images in the stream with uniform spacing, and avoid forced crops.

    Defer specific builder choices; the goal is a layout that feels editorial but updates like a simple gallery each week.
